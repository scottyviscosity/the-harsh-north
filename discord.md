# Discord
The [Harsh North Discord server](https://discord.gg/6FWfkgBX) will be where gameplay takes place.

## Using Chat Channels

Chat channels have been categorized under **In Character** and **Out of Character**. Please pay attention to the channel's context when posting questions or in game content.

All **In Character** channels should contain only in character dialog or narration of actions. The exception being the use of *[threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ)* for discussions about a particular in character post. **Use of threads in this manner is highly encouraged.**

When the party is split up, a new channel will be created to track separate scenes individually and referenced back in the main channel. These channels can optionally be marked as private to only those involved, otherwise we will leave them public for everyone to enjoy.

## Rolling Dice in Discord
I added the [avrae discord bot](https://avrae.io/commands#dice) for rolling dice in discord (it does way more than rolling dice). We don't have to use it, but if you'd like to it's not too difficult. Just type `!roll 2d6+5` for a test.

## In Character Guidelines

- Ideally, we would change our discord avatars to represent our characters.
- Speak from the character's perspective. Avoid making statements in the affirmative, instead favoring impressions and assumptions being made on the character's behalf.
- Share what the character is thinking or feeling. Inner monologue and thought process is something unique we can add in a text based campaign.

## Syntax
- Use plain text to describe actions and activity in the scene.
- Use bold braces (`**[text]**`) for proposed skill checks: **[Some Skill Check]**
- Use Italics (\`text\`) for inner monolog: `something a character is thinking internally to themselves`
- Use the Quote syntax (`> text`) for dialog: 
    > Something a character says out loud
