See the [reputation section on the character creation page](character-creation.md#reputation) for more clarity on the disparity in reputation between the social classes.

### Women
Though Norse society is patriarchal, women have a stronger place in these lands than many might suspect. A woman may own property and can become a Jarl if her husband dies and has no male offspring. It is up to the woman to decide whom she weds and if she divorces. Whilst women are expected to stay behind during raids and wars, it falls to them to protect the home, so most are competent, if not outright-skilled warriors.
