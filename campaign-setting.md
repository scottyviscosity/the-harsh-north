## Factions
See the [factions page](factions.md) for details on relevant factions surrounding Norsca.

![Norsca Factions](resources/maps/map-norsca-factions.jpg)

## Political Hierarchy
1. **Norsca** - The region where all Norscan people live; not a single nation.
1. **Kingdoms** - Collections of clans lead by a single king.
1. **Clan** - Groups of communities and peoples lead by a single strong war leader.

### Political Climate

In the Old World, cultures clash; Kingdoms and Empires struggle with another for territory and dominance. However, it is important to remember that within otherwise friendly kingdoms, or even within a single kingdom itself, there are often feuds and alliances; some petty and fleeting, and others truly blood feuds lasting generations. These machinations are too many to document in their entirety, but here are a few of the major attitudes between the Norscan Factions and their immediate neighbors.

## Culture
Loyalty is important but it cuts both ways; a crew looks out for their chief and their chief looks out for their crew. Individuals and crews sometimes change allegiance when they find a stronger leader or are wronged by their leader.

In general, strength determines leadership. The leader of a tribe can be challenged for the right of leadership. This isn't always a fight to the death. In such cases, the vanquished generally owes a life debt and chooses to follow the victorious. The one exception to this has been the High King's seat, [which is hereditary](#line-of-kings).

### Northern Clans
- In a constant state of conflict with the Kurgan of the North, their Southern brothers, and always looking to take advantage of the weak Southern Realms
- More likely to be influenced by the Northern Wastes and the powers that reside there
- Worship the old gods, the new gods, and any number of minor dieties who may show them favor
- Stick to the old ways, but have an odd way of interpreting them; often bending the rules for their own benefit and gaining a reputation for lacking honor.
- Comparison: Mythical Vikings (bloodthirsty heathens and barbarians)
- Factions: Baernsonlings, Bjornlings, Skaelings, and the Sarls.

### Southern Clans
- Value strength, wealth, solidarily, and capable warriors as their leaders
- The old ways are still central to their culture, though younger generations seem to stray further and further out of bounds. It's the old boys who hold them in the highest regards.
- Worship the old gods and view any outsider religions with skepticism and hostility
- Strong sense of community, growth, and loyalty; strive to make life better for their clan
- While viewing their Southern neighbors (e.g. Empire) as weaklings and cowards, they do envy their way of life and are jealous of their achievements. They look to build great cities, strong castles, and monuments to ensure their people are remembered forever.  
- Comparison: Real world Vikings or Scandinavians, maybe a bit of the Saxons
- Factions: Baernsonlings, Bjornlings, Skaelings, and the Sarls.

### Hillmen
- More likely to migrate than other groups
- Superstitious, Generally worshiping the old gods (the exception being some northern Hillmen)
- Hold the old ways in the highest regard
- Simple living in the most remote regions of an already harsh land.
- Names among these people generally take the form of a part hyphens with a clipped accent in the middle. (e.g. `Grom-gil-Gorm`)
- Comparison: Celtic Irish or Highlander Scots
- Factions: Most factions have some areas where this culture would be dominant, but are predominant among the Sarls, Baersonlings, and the Aeslings. 

### Wildmen
- Nomads of the Northern Wastes
- Considered savages even to the Northern Clans
- Worship dark gods who require ritual sacrafice
- Disdain "civilized" peoples
- Distinguished names amoung these people sometimes take the form of hyphenated descriptions similar to those of native americans. (e.g. `stranger-come-knocking`)
- Comparison: White Mongolians (The Hung are legit asian)
- Factions: Kurgan, Hung

### The Old Ways
Essentially this amounts to honor, or as much as can be had in a place like Norsca. These are hard men, no doubt, but they do have a code of honor and try to follow the old ways as best they can. 

The Old Ways:
- to follow your chief
- to fight bravely and earn a Name
- to speak and offer terms before a battle
- to not hurt innocent women and children
- to settle disputes with a Duel in the Circle (see below)


## Religion
See the [religion page](religion.md) for details on the faith and the gods in Norsca.


## Social Hierarchy
1. **High King** - A king with power over many kingdoms, typically via vassalage.
1. **King** - The leader of a particular kingdom or tribe.
1. **Seers** - Spiritual leaders, shamen, magi, magisters.
1. **Jarl/Chief** - Lords or Nobility; a chieftain. 
1. **Named Men** - Noted or famed warriors.
1. **Carl** - Freemen and land owners; those skilled in warfare.
1. **Peasant** - Builders, farmers, and craftsmen; those unskilled in warfare.
1. **Thrall** - Slaves of all kinds; second wives, forced laborers, servants, levy soldiers.

> _See the [reputation section on the character creation page](character-creation.md#reputation) for more clarity on the disparity in reputation between the social classes._

### Named Men
At the top of the non-ruling social scale are the Named Men, those warriors who have earned great respect in battle. Most earn badass names, like Shama Heartless, the Bloody-Nine, or Tul Duru Thunderhead. Sometimes however, they gets pegged with an unfortunate nicknames, such as Forley the Weakest or Caul Shivers, who fell in a freezing river during a raid.

### Women
Though Norse society is patriarchal, women have a stronger place in these lands than many might suspect. A woman may own property and can become a Jarl if her husband dies and has no male offspring. It is up to the woman to decide whom she weds and if she divorces. While women are generally expected to stay behind during raids and wars, it falls to them to protect the home. Most are competent, if not skilled warriors in their own right. It is not unheard of to have a shield maiden join the shield wall alongside her clansmen. If a woman is skilled and favored enough, she can be given the right to join a raid.


## Military
Norscan armies are grouped about the chieftains of the clans, strong war leaders in their own right. Most of the soldiers are Thralls; peasants young and old pressed into service and lightly armed. In the past these were badly trained, but recent wars have been raging for so long that many have become hard fighters. Each chieftain keeps household warriors called Carls, well-armed, armoured, skilled, and disciplined. Lastly there are the Named Men, who might lead groups of Carls on the field, or act as scouts or raiders deep in the enemyâ€™s terrain.

### Duels in the Circle
The Duel in the Circle, a one-on-one fight to the death between champions, is used to resolve disputes without war. The form of a Duel is highly ritualised. The men fight in a circle six good strides across, with the grass shaved to the roots. Carls from both parties form a shield-wall around the edge, allowing only one man to leave alive. Before the bout, a judge introduces the champions, confirms the stakes, and chooses weapons by the spin of a shield. Thus each man can bring any weapon, but might have to fight with his opponents. Any form of cheating in a Duel is considered a terrible crime. The victor can choose to spare the life of his opponent, which means the man owes a debt of loyalty for the rest of his life.


## Moons: Mannslieb & Morrslieb
The Warhammer world is orbited by two moons:
- **Mannslieb:** white, large, present from beginning of time
- **Morrslieb:** green, small, new and ever changing

![Wahammer Moons](https://1d4chan.org/images/a/a2/Warhammer_Moons.png)

The larger of the two moons is called Mannslieb and it acts and appears as any normal moon, having a cycle of 25 days from full to full, and orbits the planet upon a predictable orbit. Mannslieb means "Beloved of Manann" in Reikspiel and this moon is held sacred to Manann, god of the Sea.

Morrslieb, the smaller moon, is all but predictable; appearing sometimes closer and other times farther away than its partner. Its position has major influence upon the Winds of Magic. The name Morrslieb (meaning "Beloved of Morr") is in honor of Morr, the god of the dead.

A common legend tells that daemons once preyed upon the people of the world from a gateway in the sky, until Morr inflicted a great death upon them. Afterwards he fashioned the second moon from the wreckage of the daemons, so that mortals would never forget how he had saved them.

The second legend, which is mainly held by followers of Chaos, is that upon the collapse of the polar warp gates, a great block of Warpstone was hurled high into the sky, where it now circles the planet endlessly, spreading Chaos over the lands which it passes.

From time to time, meteors of Warpstone coming from Morrslieb fall upon the planet.

There are two nights in the year in which both moons are full at the same time. The first is called Hexensnacht ("Witching Night") and the other one Geheimnisnacht ("Night of Mystery"). To most, these are greatly feared and ill-omened nights of the year, and even the most cynical sceptic will avoid the eerie light cast by the full moons. On the other hand, gatherings and ritual sacrifices are held by the worshippers of Chaos on these nights.

## Line of Kings
The Line of Kings was established by Hunlaf Wolfclaw Thorsson after receiving a blessing to do so by Olric (more can be read about Olric further down) and the leaders of the Wolfclaw clan have inherited the title of High King ever since. The Wolfclaw clan is a strange oddity. They have no lands, they are a relatively small clan whose only claim to fame is that they established a royal line of High Kings. Yet it is this very claim that keeps their clan in power. 

This arrangement also means that the High King has very little power in truth. At most, he is a mediator to act for ongoing disputes between the clans as he is considered neutral. The High King has no actual sway or control over the other clans as they are left to do as they please. He can however issue edicts, but he has no power to actually enforce them. There are always exceptions however, and history has proven that a powerful High King is capable of uniting all of Norsca against a common foe.

The High King rules from the fortress of **Heorot**. Heorot is a vast forest of tall iron-clad walls that sits at the southern-western base at the Sea of Claws. In ancient times, it was common for the other clans to serve the High King by giving him the best warriors to serve him. Upon such an act, the warrior in question must shed all loyalty to his old clan and serve the High King in absolute. This ancient custom died out as a result of internal feuding and the fact that taking an oath to swear loyalty to the High King was often, at times, not enough for clansmen to forget their bitter hatred for their rivals. **As such, the Wolfclaw clan has had to rely more heavily on the Skaeling clan for support, which has swayed their favor to the point of dispute among the other clans.**


## Magic of the North
Norscan magic is called Murkr. It is a wild untamed magic seeped in ritual. Unlike the magic of the southern provinces, Murkr magic requires specific ingredients and ritual to perform. Even the most basic of Murkr magic requires some form of substance to function. It is steeped in ritualism and often requires blood sacrifice. Yet when it does function, it is potent and powerful. Due to the close vicinity of the northern wastes, Norsca is seeped in powerful winds of magic, and those who know how to channel that magic can unleash deadly untold destruction. A good comparison between the different schools of magic can be made using this example: If a human wizard of the Empire wished to cast a spell, he need only perform the words needed to be said in its arcane tongue, and thus cast the spell.

However, if a Norscan shaman who practiced Murkr wished to cast a similar spell, he would first need the ingredients to do so, and second, perform it in a ritualistic manner. As such, Murkr does not make good combat magic as it requires preparation and considerable time to perform. But the Norscanâ€™s do not use Murkr in an offensive manner. They use it to make their lives easier or when tradition calls for its use such during times of great sacrifices and celebration. Murkr excels however when used in a defensive manner.
