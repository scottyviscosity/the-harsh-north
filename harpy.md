# Harpy.gg

## Get Started
1. Make a **free account** at [harpy.gg](harpy.gg)
1. Ask the GM for an invite to the game
1. Use the Arena app to participate in the various scenes

## Arena
The invite link should take you directly to the game's arena app home page. I will assign you to your character when I send you an invite, which should let you move the token around yourself.

You can chat, look things up in the codex, and of course view the battle map. There are also controls for drawing shapes, but this app is still in beta so it's still lacking features.

The app works well on mobile and desktop, though the controls take a minute to get used to.

### Mobile
- One finger to rotate (weird)
- Two fingers to pan
- Two finger pinch/spread to zoom
- Tap and hold, then drag to move a token

### Desktop
- Left click to rotate (weird)
- Scroll to zoom
- Middle click and drag to pan
- Click and drag to move a token

### Common Controls
- The Eye button in the action bar at the bottom allows you to toggle 2D and 3D. Stick with 2D.
- The Eye button also lets you draw shapes, but not lines

## Other Apps
Harpy does have built in support for other apps like Codex and Taless, both of which we will not be using party because we already have things set up elsewhere and partly because of subscription fees.

## Permissions
If you feel like you're not able to see or access something let me know. Initially I plan on keeping things limited to the Arena app and only including a single `Details` page for each NPC for your convenience. The content there should match what I am maintaining in the GitHub wiki's dramatis personae.
