# Character Creation

## Inspiration
- Feel free to use [this board for character inspiration](https://pin.it/2efSdAR)
- Vikings TV Series
- Last Kingdom TV Series
- First Law trilogy
- Warhammer universe

## Classes
The following character classes are permitted with minor revisions for flavor:
- Barbarian
  - The _Crimson Mist_ ability may be triggered at any time once per day instead of requiring a successful save against terror.
- Ranger (`Borderer` in the rulebook)
- ~~Noble~~ (`Not permitted`)
- Outrider (`Nomad` in the rulebook)
- Raider (`Pirate` in the rulebook)
- Scholar (_caster_)
- Soldier
- Rogue (`Thief` in the rulebook)

## Races
Since we'll be playing in Norsca, the only playable race will be human. We'll keep it simple and use the standard Human race from pathfinder. 

In general, I expect every player to be a Norscan. Under extremely special circumstances I may allow you to be from a neighboring human region (say you started out as an Impirial who is a captured slave), but the goal is to have every player act as a true Norscan and be working for the same kingdom or tribe.

**Standard Racial Traits**
- **Ability Score Modifiers:** Human characters gain a +2 racial bonus to one ability score of their choice at creation to represent their varied nature.
- **Bonus Feat:** Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.
- **Skilled:** Humans gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level.
- **Size:** Humans are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Base Speed:** Humans have a base speed of 30 feet.
- **Languages:** Humans begin play speaking Common. Humans with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic). See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.

## Feats/Flaws
Players are permitted two flaws to help give their character depth. As usual for each flaw taken you may select an additional bonus feat. Flaws and bonus feats may only be selected at character creation.

- I don't like how limited the list is, so feel free to create and submit your own flaws for approval.

## Fate Points
Each player will begin the game with **3 fate points**. I do not plan on handing these out for any rewards during the game, so use them wisely.

See `Page 95` of the Conan core rule book for more details on fate points and their uses.

## Starting money
See `Page 97` of the Conan core rule book.

## Reputation

See `Page 104` of the Conan core rule book for initial details. **A campaign specific chart will be posted here at some point.**
