# Character Creation

## Inspiration

## General
- **Character sheet:** Use this [customized Conan d20 character sheet](resources/harsh-north-character-sheet.pdf).
- **Starting Level:** 2
- **Starting Stats:** You may assign the following starting values to any of your starting stats: 16, 14, 12, 12, 10, 8.
- **Hitpoints:** All characters will gain maximum hitpoints at each level.
- **Starting Money:** See `Page 97` of the Conan core rule book.
- **Alignment:** Alignment is not a concept in this campaign. _"There are no good or bad men, it all depend on where you stand."_

## Classes
The following character classes are permitted with minor revisions for flavor:
- Barbarian
  - The _Crimson Mist_ ability may be triggered at any time once per day instead of requiring a successful save against terror.
- Ranger (`Borderer` in the rulebook)
- ~~Noble~~ (`Not permitted`)
- Outrider (`Nomad` in the rulebook)
- Raider (`Pirate` in the rulebook)
- Scholar (_caster_)
- Soldier
- Rogue (`Thief` in the rulebook)

## Races
Since we'll be playing in Norsca, the only playable race will be human. We'll keep it simple and use the standard Human race from pathfinder. 

In general, I expect every player to be a Norscan of clan **Skaeling**. Under extremely special circumstances I may allow you to be from a neighboring human region (say you started out as an Impirial who is a captured slave), but the goal is to have every player act as a true Norscan and be working for the same kingdom or clan.

**Standard Racial Traits**
- **Ability Score Modifiers:** Human characters gain a +2 racial bonus to one ability score of their choice at creation to represent their varied nature.
- **Bonus Feat:** Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.
- **Skilled:** Humans gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level.
- **Size:** Humans are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Base Speed:** Humans have a base speed of 30 feet.
- **Languages:** Humans begin play speaking Common. Humans with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic). See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.

### Culture
Although everyone will be human, there are some variations in terms of clan culture based on where you were raised. It is not uncommon for a Northman to be born in one region but migrate to another, following a strong leader... or greater glory for himself.

It's a good idea to review the [factions page](factions.md) if you're not familiar with the clans. I've also included some detail on the [differences in culture between the various groups](culture.md#regional-cultures). It's assumed you will belong to the Southern Clan culture since you will be Skaeling. However, if you find the other cultures intriguing, it wouldn't be unreasonable to have your character be a migrant from another region. Although, this could introduce some complications for your character depending on where you originate from.

## Feats/Flaws
Players are permitted two flaws to help give their character depth. As usual for each flaw taken you may select an additional bonus feat. Flaws and bonus feats may only be selected at character creation.

- [Standard list of D20 Flaws](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/buildingCharacters/characterFlaws.htm)
- [List of Pathfinder Drawbacks (flaws)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks/)
- I don't like how limited the lists are, so feel free to create and submit your own flaws for approval.

## Fate Points
Each player will begin the game with **3 fate points**. I do not plan on handing these out for any rewards during the game, so use them wisely.

See `Page 95` of the Conan core rule book for more details on fate points and their uses.
