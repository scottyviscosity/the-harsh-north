# Olricstaad
Olricstaad , the largest trading port in all of Norsca . Unlike the other cities of Norsca, this one consists of stone buildings and is really strongly fortified. There are also some residents of other kingdoms here who pay their respects in the Hochk√∂nig Svein Royal Trade Hall . Almost all ships from Marienburg dock here. The city lies on the Halkild , which is fed by the meltwater from the Jutonheimen Mountains.
