## Norscan Faith
Norscan faith is an extremely complex affair. Their pantheon is called Raenir, and is comprised of numerous divine aspects that are far too many to list. Such is the complicated dynamic nature of the Raenir pantheon that it has confused and caused many a headache for southern theology experts.

Each clan worships their own deities that varies greatly with each clan. Norscan worship can be divided into four parts, with the bottom representing lowest rank (Ancestor Spirits):
- Worship of Ancestor Spirits (Said to watch over them from Raenisheim, their spirit world)
- Worship of Dead Heroes
- Worship of Daemons
- Worship of the Gods (including Chaos Gods)

In addition to this, their pantheon often reflects four central themes:
- War
- Desire
- Decay
- Hope

Raenir (Norscan pantheon) can be further broken into two parts for the gods:
- Æsafólk: These are the non-chaos gods, and are **heavily worshiped within the southern clans.**
- Vanenes: These are the Chaos Gods, influenced all over Norsca but **primarily in the north.**

Great heroes are also worshiped, but each clan will have their own hero. A clan will not worship a hero that belongs to another rival clan for example. Heroes are worshiped in lesser detail; there is no special holy days or symbols. Instead they are remembered during other festivals devoted to their reigning god and a small prayer or a sacrifice is often enough to give these ‘Venerated Souls' their blessing.

## The Unending Winter
Norscan belief states that the ending of the world will happen when Olric will rally all Einherjar (ancient name of the Norscans) to join the Raenir in the last Great War against Chaos. Of course, worshipers of the Chaos Gods do not believe in this part. To them this is the day their masters will finally devour the world.

The Unending Winter will be preceeded by the Fimbulwinter, meaning ‘The Winter Without End.' Three successive winters will follow each other with no summer in sight. It is said that during this time both the Sun and Mannslieb will fall. Morrslieb (they call it Roedredsel) will dominate the sky evermore. The stars will vanish from the sky and the world will fall into darkness. The earth will shudder so violently that trees will be uprooted, mountains will fall, and every bond and fetter will snap and sever. After this the final battle will begin…

# Old Gods

## Olric
- Title(s): Olric, Olrik, Winter's Fury, Snow King, Ursash, Ukko, Odin
- Sphere of Influence: War, winter, wolves, excellence in arms, leadership, knowledge, wisdom, survival, shapeshifting
- Common Worshippers: Leaders, warriors, shapeshifters (Wolf)
- Symbols: Wolf symbols and wolf skins.
- Sacred/Totem Animals: Wolf

The principal deity and leader of the Raenir in the old Norse/Norsii pantheon, Olric is worshipped by warriors and most common folk as the God of battle, winter, and wolves. He is viewed as the High God. Olric is the ruler of Kregnihalla where the souls of those meeting a warrior's death find eternal battle and feasting. These Aandkregnir await the day of the Endeslagok when Olric will call upon all them to join the Raenir in the last Great War. 

Portrayed as a massive warrior, Olric has long hair and black beard silvered by hoar frost. He wears a wolf-skin cloak. Sometimes Olric also appears as a huge silver-grey wolf. Norse legends tell that Olric and Ursun are brothers and that there is great rivalry between them. In truth Olric's position as the principal deity and the main God is very much challenged by Kharnath. Most of the Norse see now days Kharnath as the High God and his Brass Halls as the Kregnihalla. Many Norse also believe that Ulric is brother of Kharnath.

# Chaos Gods

The Chaos Gods, also referred to as the Ruinous Powers, are daemonic gods or entities whose power derives from the darker emotions and deepest psychological drives of the various intelligent species of the Warhammer World.

There are many of them extant within the Realm of Chaos but four -- Khorne, Tzeentch, Slaanesh and Nurgle -- are particularly infamous and powerful. Each embodies a particular and very basic aspect of mortal existence, those being wrath, change, pleasure, and death, respectively.

## Khorne

![Mark of Khorne](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/1/17/MarkofKhorneBig.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/275?cb=20170908233325)

- Title(s): The Blood God, The Lord of Skulls, Portfolio, Blood, War, Hatred and Murder
- Portfolio: Blood, War, Hatred and Murder
- Sacred Number: 8
- Sacred Colours: Blood Red, Black, and Brass
- Greater Daemon: Bloodthirster
- Lesser Daemon(s): Bloodletter, Flesh Hound of Khorne, Juggernaut
- Traitor Legion: World Eaters
- Rival God: Slaanesh, Tzeentch

Khorne, also known as Kharneth, the Blood God, the Lord of Murder and the Hunter of Souls, is the Chaos God of War, Honour, Courage, Rage, Strength and Hate. His domain of power encompasses the most basic and brutal of sentient emotion and every act of killing is said to empower Him, the more vicious and bloodthirsty the better. He is said to smile upon feats of valour, strength and blood-drenched warrior skill, and is the patron of proud warriors who set themselves against the odds and emerge triumphant through strength and skill. Khorne is said to exalt the brave of both sides of the battle, while at the same time laying his terrible vengeance upon the cowardly and craven.

On one side of his nature, Khorne is the embodiment of honour and courage, and a man that has put his faith in Khorne is just as likely to be an honourable warrior as he is a blood-crazed killer, and oftentimes he will be both at the same time. The Warriors of Khorne, though gore-maddened berserkers all, take no artful approach to killing, for such indulgent displays serve only to empower Slaanesh, the honourless adversary of Khorne amongst the company of the gods. It is also due to the warrior-code of the devotees of Khorne, who believe it is the solemn right of every warrior to die an honourable death in battle with sword and axe in hand. Khorne is the second eldest and perhaps the mightiest of the Gods of Chaos.

Khorne is known by a thousand, thousand names in the North. He is known as Kharneth, Akhar, Kjorn, Khorgar, the Axefather, the Bloodfather, the Bloodwolf and the Wolf-Father, and yet other uncounted multitudes of titles and aspects. The Blood God is worshipped by almost every clan in the North, for the Northmen are warrior-peoples who exalt in the contest of arms. Particularly the Norscans, who most eagerly of all embrace Khorne's call to eternal warfare.

## Tzeentch

![Mark of Tzeentch](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/8/8b/TzeentchMark.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/297?cb=20170908232309)

- Title(s): The Changer of Ways, The Lord of Change, Architect of Fate
- Portfolio: Change, Evolution, Intrigue, Ambition, Knowledge, Sorcery
- Sacred Number: 9
- Sacred Colours: Blue and Gold or ever-changing rainbow
- Greater Daemon: Lord of Change
- Lesser Daemon(s): Horror of Tzeentch, Flamer of Tzeentch, Screamer
- Traitor Legion: Thousand Sons
- Rival God: Nurgle

Tzeentch, also known as Tchar, The Wind-lord, Chi'an Chi (in Cathay), The Eagle (in Norsca), The Raven God, the Changer of Ways and the Great Conspirator is the Chaos God of Magic, Change, Evolution, Destiny, Lies and Trickery. He is flux embodied, a daemon-god who alone truly embodies the terrible energies and momentum of Chaos. He bears a strong claim to all who profess to worship the Northern Gods, for without transformation, a warrior cannot ascend to greatness, the gods cannot grant their blessings, and the living cannot die.

Tzeentch's name is derivative from his true name in the Dark Tongue; Tzeen'neth, Lord of Change. He is the Great Sorcerer of Chaos, and Bringer of Change, for make no mistake -- endless, broiling change is the truest nature of Chaos, and Chaos is the source of the eldritch energies that mortals, in their superstition, have named "magic."

## Slaanesh

## Nurgle

![Mark of Nurgle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/1/1a/MarkofNurgleBig.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/316?cb=20170908232551)

- Title(s): Plague Lord, Plague God,Lord of Decay, Grandfather Nurgle, 
- Portfolio: Disease, Decay, Despair, Death, Destruction
- Sacred Number: 7
- Sacred Colours: Putrid browns and bilious greens
- Greater Daemon: Great Unclean One
- Lesser Daemon(s): Plaguebearer, Nurglings, Rot Fly, Beast of Nurgle
- Traitor Legion: Death Guard
- Rival God: Tzeentch

Nurgle, also known as the Plague Lord, the Lord of Pestilence, the Fly Lord, and the Urfather is the Chaos God of Disease, Decay, Destruction, and Death by Rebirth. He is the eldest of the four Chaos Gods and is the most directly involved with the plight of mortals, particularly Humans who suffer so acutely from a fear of death. Indeed, Nurgle is undoubtedly the oldest of the Chaos Gods, for the process of death and decay is as old as Life itself. When the first forms of life had lived upon the universe, they've lived and then would inevitably die, and from this death came the primordial Nurgle.[1f][2a][2c]

On one side of his nature, Nurgle is unexpectedly also the personification of Rebirth. After all, decay is simply one part of the cycle of life, without which no new life could grow. In the same way, Nurgle also personifies Perseverance and Survival. While those who wish to spread decay and corruption are certainly amongst his followers, there are also those who wish to endure, to become tough enough to handle the difficulties and opportunities presented by an uncaring world. Many of those affected by Nurgle's poxes usually turn to him in order to escape the pain caused by sickness and disease, and while the other three Gods of Chaos have little care for their followers, it is Nurgle who places an uncommon love, admiration, and faith upon those that would follow his blighted footsteps.
